# Horiseon-HW1
First assignment TEC

1. First Homework was to Refactor the Code already given, meaning to not alter any of the fucntions, but rather improve the code. 

2. I was given the following Acceptance Criteria instructions:

    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the icon and image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title  

3. I first removed all of the "<div>" from the index file and added corresponding semantic elements which would be easier to read in case the webpage needs to be intervined. 

4. This lead me to modify the style sheet to use the new semantic elements on it.
5. Added "alt" to every image. Corrected links fucntionality using "<id> and # "
6. Simplified classes that did the same thing twice. By either creating a general semantic element, or by using one class. 
7. Correctly used the <h> tags to be in sequential order. 
8. Commented briefly on the behavior of each of the sections in the styles sheet.
9. Added a title corresponding to the webpage.
